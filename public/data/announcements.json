Small lil‚Äô update for everyone.\n\nFirstly, thank you to everyone who participated in the 2x MMR day- we had a lot of participation and the technical side went off flawlessly. I will be including a poll in the near future to discuss a potential weekly +50% MMR day.\n\nLastly, as you may have read. We are rapidly approaching 1000 members and we would like all the help you guys can give to push us there as once at 1000 members we can apply for Discord Discovery. So as a little push and a thank you for everyone we will offer three potential events that you all will get to vote on- until we reach 1000 members the events will be hidden will be revealed once we reach our goal! \n\nThank you everyone for helping make this server thrive! Looking forward to our future!"

Starting World Cup we will limit ability bans to 1 per team.\n\nIt is also important to mention the Double Random Tournament will not have any bans or unbans as having 2 ability slots as random is already very limiting.\n\nIn addition, after prolonged discussion we will be reworking season 2 points to make them more equitable to all. This means the points for masters tournament will be declined whereas points for participating will be increased, all of this and a bit more to come!\n\nThanks all! Bopl On'\n-Gussie\n\nP.S We are still looking for a social media coordinator- so if you are interested please let me know"
